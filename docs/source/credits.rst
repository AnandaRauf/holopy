The package includes code from several sources.  We thank Daniel
Mackowski for allowing us to include his T-Matrix code, which computes
scattering from clusters of spheres:  SCSMFO1B_.

We also make use of a modified version of the Python version of mpfit_, originally developed by Craig Markwardt. The modified version we use is drawn from the stsci_python_ package.

Finally, we thank A. Ross Barnett for permitting us to use his routine SBESJY.FOR_, which computes spherical Bessel functions.
